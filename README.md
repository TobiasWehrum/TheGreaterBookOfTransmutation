# The Greater Book of Transmutation

After missing last year's NaNoGenMo, I thought I should finally take the plunge [this year](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015). Nevermind that I never made any generative text before.

The Greater Book of Transmutation is mainly based on a free association database that I found [here](http://web.usf.edu/FreeAssociation). It's about making things, using materials that are commonly associated with them - e.g., a cat might be made from "being feline", "claws", "meows" and "being graceful" and "tail". Throw in a system of tools with actions that use/transform materials, a bit of word classification, markov-chain latin words generator, a lot of sillyness and whatever else I will add before the month ends, and you get something like:

> How to make a book in 12 easy steps:
> 
> Materials:
>  - 10 hymns
>  - 178 readings
>  - 10 clear concepts of poem
>  - 4 clear concepts of guide
> 
> Tools:
>  - bucket with  water
>  - vessel
>  - pet unicorn
>  - ballpoint pen
> 
> Instructions:
> 
> 1. Let vessel cool down.
> 2. Heat vessel.
> 3. Dip 10 clear concepts of poem into the bucket with  water.
> 4. Feed 10 clear concepts of wet poem to your pet unicorn.
> 5. Let your pet unicorn lick 10 hymns.
> 6. Pet your pet unicorn.
> 7. Wait for a long time.
> 8. Wait until your pet unicorn poops. Receive 124.89 ounces of a very dirty pile of "wet poem"
> 9. Draw a magic circle on the floor using the ballpoint pen.
> 10. Draw a cross into the circle and place 10 licked hymns, 178 readings, 4 clear concepts of guide and 124.89 ounces of a very dirty pile of "wet poem" on each corner.
> 11. Whisper the following spell: "Alchemia implacabilis! Meio clystermitto clodigo condocefaciencia, millibi! Verca bisellatrocinium! Creditor circumbrans!"
> 12. Reluctantly, a book will appear inside the circle.

That might also help those that are struggling to make a book. And if you are missing one of the materials or tools, maybe another entry in The Greater Book of Transmutation could help you make it!
